# How to submit your translation...

First off you will need to click on the addon that you want to translate (for example click on gride_lang.txt)

Next you will need to click the edit button (as seen here http://i.xxlmm13xxgaming.com/a876dce4bbb90420e8d9eb58c5963a92.png)

Now you will need to copy the whole English translation (PLEASE ALWAY START FROM THE ENGLISH SECTION!) and paste it under the actual English translation... so now you can see 2 "English" translations

Change every langconfig["English"] to langconfig["YourLangHere"] (put the full word for your language EX. French)

Now you can start to translate from English to your language!

When you are finished you can click the "Propose file change" button at the bottom of the page (as seen here http://i.xxlmm13xxgaming.com/b4888e73ca207b9495f1696cc06ba95c.png)

On the next page please click the "Create pull request" button at the top (as seen here http://i.xxlmm13xxgaming.com/4445d3c802868507884b7a0ef479aedd.png)

And last fill out the next box as seen below replacing "French" with the language you translated! (or if you did French then keep it :))

I thank you very much for doing this :)

Keep in mind if you ever see 'tokens' (EX. "{GRide_Customer}") my system will automatically replace those with the var needed in the addon!
