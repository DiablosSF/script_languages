# How to submit your translation...

First off you will need to click on the addon that you want to translate (for example click on gride_lang.txt)

Next you will need to click the edit button (as seen here http://i.xxlmm13xxgaming.com/a876dce4bbb90420e8d9eb58c5963a92.png)

Now you will need to copy the whole English translation (PLEASE ALWAY START FROM THE ENGLISH SECTION!) and paste it under the actual English translation... so now you can see 2 "English" translations

Change every langconfig["English"] to langconfig["YourLangHere"] (put the full word for your language EX. French)

Now you can start to translate from English to your language!

I thank you very much for doing this :)

Keep in mind if you ever see 'tokens' (EX. "{GRide_Customer}") my system will automatically replace those with the var needed in the addon!
